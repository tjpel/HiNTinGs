0,0,0,0,data/example1.txt,What is Langchain?,LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides modular abstractions for the components necessary to work with language models and allows language models to interact with their environment. The LangChain framework is designed to enable data-aware applications that connect a language model to other sources of data and agentic applications that allow a language model to interact with its environment.,LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.,1.0,Provided more information than necessary.
