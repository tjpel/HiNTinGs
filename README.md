# HinTinGs AI

Hintings is an advanced Document Question Answering (QA) system that utilizes cutting-edge large language models (LLM), such as ChatGPT and GPT 4, to improve retrieval augmented generation. By seamlessly integrating external tools like Serpapi for web search, LLM math capabilities, and Gradio tools, Hintings offers a powerful and comprehensive solution that goes beyond conventional QA tasks.

Safety and reliability are our top priorities in the system design. To ensure precise responses and minimize the risk of hallucination, we have integrated NeMo-Guardrails from NVIDIA into our application.

Initiated and developed at AI Camp during the summer of 2023.
